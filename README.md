CAREER DESCRIPTION: I graduated from high school a month ago (June 20th, 2025), and I am going to be a freshman at CUNY Hunter College in fall 2025 and plan to major in Computer Science. I enjoy learning about various coding languages, frameworks, tools, IDEs, software, and especially Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. However, I also enjoy some business-related fields, such as economics, finance, and banking. I want to use my technical skills to solve business related problems! I'm always open to CS and business-related internships, programs, mentorship, and entry-level roles, so feel free to reach out to me!!
